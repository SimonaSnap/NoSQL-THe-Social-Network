## Usage 
The user needs a platform like Insomnia, so that after cloning the repository, they are able to set up the dependencies using "npm i" in VS Code, and then launch the application using "node index" from the main folder of the application. At that point the user can launch Insomnia, and use the localhost url to go through the different routes set up in the application to interaci with users and thoughts.
